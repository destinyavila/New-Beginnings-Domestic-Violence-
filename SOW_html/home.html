  <h2>What Is Domestic Violence?</h2>
  <p>
    Domestic violence is violence committed by someone in the victim’s domestic
    circle. This includes partners and ex-partners, immediate family members,
    other relatives and family friends.

  The term ‘domestic violence’ is used when there is a close relationship
  between the offender and the victim. There is usually a power gap between them.
  The victim is dependent on the offender. Domestic violence can take the form
  of physical, sexual or psychological abuse.Abuse is not love. It is one person
  in a relationship having power and control over the other person.

    Domestic violence takes many forms: physical; emotional; economic; stalking and harassment; and sexual.
