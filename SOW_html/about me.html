          My Name is Destiny Avila I am a fifften year old Belizean High School Student. The main goal of my webside is to create awareness on Domestic Violenc. Domestic Violence is a grave issue in Belize that not many talk about or help. This website is to help educate the importance to speak up is you are being abused. There are millions of women, child and even men that are being abused everyday. Everyday someone could be dying at the hands of the ones they call "soulmates or parents." There are individuals who will help and listen but we have to be willing to voice our abuse to get help.
